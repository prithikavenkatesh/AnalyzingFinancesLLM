      "national policies, strategies, and case studies aimed at minimising municipal solid waste (MSW).\n",
      "It evaluates the environmental, social, and economic impacts of waste and explores the transition\n",
      "from conventional landfill reliance to sustainable waste management practices. Key ZW approaches,\n",
      "including circular economy frameworks and extended producer responsibility (EPR), are examined\n",
      "through case studies from countries such as China, Germany, and the United States. The review\n",
      "highlights advancements in waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies, the development of zero waste\n",
      "cities, and the critical role of policies in achieving significant MSW reduction. Additionally, it\n",
      "identifies key challenges such as infrastructure gaps and regulatory weaknesses and offers practical\n",
      "solutions to overcome these barriers. This study serves as a valuable resource for policymakers\n",
      "aiming to implement effective waste reduction strategies and enhance sustainable waste management\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Waste, regardless of it is type or location, is often recognised as an environmental\n",
      "concern. However, it also carries significant social and financial implications [ 1]. Every\n",
      "instance of discarding a basic consumable food item, a damaged toy, a replaced electronic\n",
      "device, or any other form of disposal contributes to resource depletion and exacerbates\n",
      "environmental challenges globally [2]. When an item is discarded and classified as waste,\n",
      "a unique set of challenges emerges in terms of its management and treatment. Several\n",
      "factors contribute to waste generation, with one key factor being the production of items\n",
      "with limited lifespans, such as perishable foods, electronic devices, clothing, and furniture.\n",
      "Additionally, large agricultural areas are devoted to growing crops that are eventually\n",
      "wasted [1]. Waste production has historically been a result of human behaviour. Municipal\n",
      "solid waste (MSW) includes materials no longer wanted by the individual or entity that\n",
      "generated them, such as food and agricultural waste, along with discarded consumer\n",
      "products and their packaging. Once MSW is generated, it typically accumulates before\n",
      "being processed. Waste management involves the handling and treating of materials that\n",
      "may be reused, recovered, or disposed of [ 3]. The escalating production of MSW has\n",
      "become a more urgent concern worldwide, especially in newly developing and emerging\n",
      "nations. In these areas, current facilities and MSW management practices often struggle\n",
      "to cope with the growing amount of MSW caused by an increasing population, economic\n",
      "expansion, and rising urbanisation [4].\n",
      "The global average waste production is 0.74 kg per person per day, while individual\n",
      "country rates vary significantly, ranging from 0.11 to 4.54 kg per person daily. Waste\n",
      "production numbers are often linked to income levels and rates of urbanisation [ 5]. In\n",
      "2012, urban areas globally produced around 1.3 billion tonnes of MSW annually [6], and\n",

      "amount of waste produced in low-income nations is projected to more than triple by 2050.\n",
      "Middle-income countries currently generate around 61% of global waste, while high- and\n",
      "low-income nations contribute about 34% and 5%, respectively. Organic waste constitutes\n",
      "approximately 50% of waste in low- to middle- incomes. In high-income nations, although\n",
      "the absolute volume of organic matter is similar, due to larger amounts of packaging and\n",
      "other inorganic waste, the proportion of organic material is around 32%. The proportion\n",

      "The demand for the proper disposal and treatment of waste emerged when people\n",
      "transitioned from scattered geographical regions to concentrated settlements. The increased\n",
      "populations of cities and towns led to an increase in waste, which became a troublesome\n",
      "issue [21]. The Greeks established the first recognised ‘municipal landfills’ in the Western\n",
      "World and enacted the first documented prohibiting of the disposal of waste in the streets\n",
      "in 500 BC [3]. The first evidence of waste being incinerated as a means of disposal may\n",
      "be traced back to the beginning of the first millennium in Palestine. During the Middle\n",
      "Ages, the issue of waste disposal persisted as a troublesome problem for urban inhabitants.\n",
      "Litter was often discarded into the streets, resulting in unpleasant odours and promoting\n",
      "the proliferation of pests and diseases [21]. The Cold War saw the emergence of academic\n",
      "interest in consumer history as a topic at the centre of the political and ideological struggle\n",
      "between communism and capitalism. From that point on, consumption was seen as a key\n",
      "factor in economic development [16]. The amount of waste generated these days is much\n",
      "higher compared with the late 19th century; this is due to the introduction of one-time-use\n",
      "products into market such as razors and canned foods, among others. As a result, it places\n",
      "significant pressure on authorities, who must handle it effectively [22].\n",
      "During the period between 1750 and 1850, the industrial revolution in Europe resulted\n",
      "in a significant migration of people from rural regions to urban centres. This led to a\n",
      "substantial growth in the urban population and, therefore, a rise in the amount of waste\n",
      "generated. The rise in home waste generation was accompanied by an associated rise\n",
      "in waste from industries resulting from the rapid growth of large-scale manufacturing\n",
      "operations. The waste that was produced consisted of various elements including shattered\n",

      "significant risk to human health and attracted flies, rodents, and other pests, which, in turn,\n",
      "might potentially spread diseases. Consequently, there was a growing recognition of the\n",
      "connection between the environment and public health. The first European Union (EU)\n",
      "policy paper on waste, known as the “Community strategy for waste Management”, was\n",
      "created in 1989 as a component of the Fourth Environmental Action Programme (1987-92).\n",
      "The policy outlines the concepts of the management of waste hierarchy, which include\n",
      "the employment of clean and advanced technology to avoid waste, waste reutilisation\n",
      "and recycling, and the optimisation of ultimate disposal methods. The idea of proximity,\n",
      "which states that waste should be managed as close to its origin as feasible, together with\n",
      "the objective of achieving self-reliance in the management and disposal of waste, were\n",
      "highlighted. In 1996, the European Environment Ministers approved a new waste strategy,\n",
      "which was a reassessment of the 1989 document. It also emphasised the importance of\n",
      "implementing precise emission criteria for waste incineration and effectively regulating\n",
      "waste landfills. The following Landfill of Waste Directive (1999) and the Incineration of\n",
      "Waste Directive (2000) put specific rules into effect. The management planning of waste on\n",
      "a regional and local scale, as well as suggestions for cross-border waste exports, were also\n",
      "included in the strategy [21].\n",
      "In terms of waste produced from packaging products, the obligation to take care of it\n",
      "in Germany was previously mandated by the Packaging Ordinance (VerpackV) in 1991. The\n",
      "document includes regulations about the responsibility of manufacturers and distributors\n",
      "to obligate and recycle discarded packaging. Retailers may fulfil this responsibility by\n",
      "engaging in a program that facilitates the gathering and reprocessing of that waste. In\n",
      "1993, Germany implemented a collection and disposal system that was in line with the\n",
      "existing regulations. Consequently, there was a notable decrease in the percentage of\n",
      "packaging found in municipal waste. The Federal Environment Ministry of Germany\n",
      "implemented a program that includes a voluntary agreement to steadily enhance the\n",
      "recycling rate of paper waste since 1994. From 2001, Germany has made efforts to maintain\n",
      "a consistent rate of 80%. As of 1 June 2005, it is no longer permissible to dispose of waste in\n",
      "landfills without it undergoing pre-treatment. The pre-treatment process occurs in either\n",
      "incineration facilities or mechanical biological processing facilities. Also, it is required\n",
      "that the waste be treated to prevent degradation inside a landfill. Prior to landfilling, it\n",
      "is necessary to extract recoverable recyclables, and the energy produced from the wastes\n",
      "must be used. In 2010, Germany obtained an impressive overall recovery percentage\n",
      "of nearly 85% for packaging waste. Furthermore, Germany has implemented a waste\n",
      "management strategy during the last two decades that relies on closed cycles and distributes\n",
      "the responsibility of disposing of items to producers and distributors. It has heightened\n",
      "people’s awareness of the need to segregate waste, prompted the implementation of novel\n",
      "waste disposal methods, and bolstered recycling capabilities [17]. A 65% waste recycling\n",
      "target was announced by government through the Circular Economy Act of 2012. Germany\n",
      "far exceeded the target long ago, with a projected recycling rate of around 67% in 2019 [23].\n",
      "In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions in recycling efforts. Several recycling\n",
      "depots either stopped or restricted their services, resulting in interruptions in certain waste\n",
      "management cycles. Additionally, there were provisional modifications in waste separation.\n",
      "The Federal Ministry of Environment instructed families with COVID-19 cases to suspend\n",
      "waste separation and dispose of all waste through residual waste disposal [ 24]. The\n",

      "was enacted mandating homeowners to maintain the area in front of their residence free\n",

      "to a surge in output and prompting people to migrate to urban areas. The initiation of\n",
      "waste control began with the enactment of the first Public Health Law in 1848. Waste\n",
      "was extracted from residences and deposited in adjacent excavations. Once the holes\n",
      "were completely filled, they were excavated, and it was transported away using a horse\n",
      "and waggon. Starting in 1875, homeowners were obligated to store waste in portable\n",
      "containers or dustbins, while municipal authorities were responsible for the disposal and\n",
      "collection of waste [ 25]. Moreover, specialised MSW incinerators were first used in the\n",

      "In recent years, ZW has been gaining considerable momentum as governments world-\n",
      "wide aim to adopt more sustainable waste management practices. The concept, which\n",
      "can be comprehensively described as the elimination of waste production and the max-\n",
      "imisation of resource recovery, offers a persuasive picture for a future in which nothing\n",
      "is wasted. Nevertheless, the journey towards achieving ZW is fraught with difficulties,\n",
      "challenges, and barriers [82]. Additionally, the practical realisation of ZW may be unattain-\n",
      "able in reality [89]. The challenges in implementing ZW include perceptions of exorbitant\n",
      "expenses, initial costs, and limited funding resources, coupled with the intricacy of its\n",
      "execution and the insufficient expertise among the specialists engaged. Additionally, con-\n",
      "trolling waste in industry is challenging because recycling will only occur if it yields a\n",
      "direct economic benefit [82]. Furthermore, the financial payback provided by recycling\n",
      "frequently proves inadequate to offset the expenses, resulting in reduced participation.\n",
      "Absent strong legislative frameworks that provide incentives for waste avoidance and\n",
      "resource recovery, the shift to ZW continues to be difficult [90]. In addition to the direct\n",
      "monetary expenses, there are also implicit ‘hidden’ costs, including the time and human\n",
      "resources that enterprises must allocate to implement environmental enhancements [91].\n",
      "Indeed, the actual achievement of ZW may be unattainable in real life. Firstly, products\n",
      "are subject to the constraints of thermodynamics, which govern that completely closed\n",
      "cycles are unattainable. If energy supplies are finite, losses are inevitable. Furthermore, a\n",
      "fully integrated recycling society would inherently imply that every product we consume\n",
      "incorporates recycled materials [92].\n",
      "Another challenge is defining the involvement of the stakeholders in order to establish\n",
      "a truly sustainable network of suppliers and a circular economy to reach ZW. Additionally,\n",
      "there is a demand for allocating resources towards the advancing research endeavours\n",
      "aimed at enhancing waste management technology, along with its widespread distribution.\n",
